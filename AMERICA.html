	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about The Statue of Liberty</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">Since 1886, the Statue of Liberty has held her torch high in New York Harbor as the quintessential symbol of American liberty, and no trip to NYC (perhaps no trip the United States), is complete without a visit to the Mother of Exiles at Liberty Island. The statue’s massive pedestal houses an observation deck as well as exhibits detailing the fascinating history of the 305-foot copper statue designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and gifted to the U.S. from France to celebrate the friendship of the two nations. Check out the original torch and read the bronze plaque with Emma Lazarus’s poem “A New Colossus” (you know, the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to be free). The National Park Service offers daily tours of Liberty Island as well as neighboring Ellis Island, which served as the first stop for more than 12 million immigrants between 1852 and 1954. While admission to both parks is technically free, visitors must buy ferry tickets to get there. Be sure to book online well in advance, as day-of tickets tend to sell out quickly—especially in the summer months.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="5"><font face="Palatino"><b>GRAND CANYON</b></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about Grand Canyon</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">So, about five to six million years ago, the Colorado River more or less established its route through the Arizona desert. Glacial erosion, meltwater runoff and the simultaneous counter effect of the land slowly rising—as the weight of the glaciers was reduced—ultimately resulted in one of the most spectacular natural wonders on our modest, little blue-green planet. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, varies between four and 18 miles wide and has a maximum depth of 6,000 feet. There are hotels and restaurants in key locations, but for the most part, you should visit and marvel at how incredible this world is—you know, before we ruin it. The Grand Canyon offers one of the most visible examples of a worldwide geological phenomenon known as the Great Unconformity, in which 250 million-year-old rock strata lie back-to-back with 1.2 billion-year-old rocks. What happened during the hundreds of millions of years between remains largely a mystery. It's in northern Arizona between Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

The Grand Canyon was carved out by the Colorado River in northern Arizona in the United States. The northeast end of the Grand Canyon starts at Lake Powell and the city of Page at the Utah-Arizona border.

We don't really know how old it is. It has long been believed that the Colorado River began carving Grand Canyon about 6 million years ago, but a 2012 study contained a real shocker, suggesting that the process may have begun as far back as 70 million years. In all likelihood, the Grand Canyon as we know it today started out as a series of smaller canyons 70 million years ago, but the majority of the canyon did not begin to take shape until much more recently.<br><br>
Grand Canyon creates its own weather! Of all Grand Canyon facts, this one is pretty cool – no pun intended. Sudden changes in elevation have an enormous impact on temperature and precipitation, so the weather you're experiencing could vary drastically depending on where you are in the Grand Canyon. The coldest, wettest weather station in the region is the Bright Angel Ranger Station on the North Rim, while the hottest (and one of the driest) is just 8 miles away at Phantom Ranch.<br><br>
There are no dinosaur bones in the canyon. Grand Canyon might look like the perfect place to go looking for dinosaur bones, but none have ever been found there, and for good reason. The rock that makes up the canyon walls is vastly more ancient than the dinosaurs – about a billion years more ancient, in some cases – but the canyon itself probably didn't form until after the dinosaurs were long gone.<br><br>
But there are lots of other fossils in the area. While the dinosaurs might have missed out on seeing the Grand Canyon, lots of other fossils have been found that suggest other creatures frequented the location. They range from ancient marine fossils dating back 1.2 billion years to fairly recent land mammals that left their remains in canyon caves about 10,000 years ago.
There's a town down in the canyon. Lists of Grand Canyon facts don’t often include information about its human population, but surprisingly, it does have one. Supai Village is located at the base of Grand Canyon within the Havasupai Indian Reservation. Inaccessible by road and with a population of just 208, it is the most remote community in the lower 48 states, and is the only place where mail is still delivered by pack mule. <br><br>
We're missing 950 million years worth of rocks! Grand Canyon offers one of the most visible examples of a worldwide geological phenomenon known as the Great Unconformity, in which 250 million-year-old rock strata lie back-to-back with 1.2 billion-year-old rocks. What happened during the hundreds of millions of years between remains largely a mystery.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">This incredible natural attraction is one of the most visited places in the United States. Carved out by the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon cuts deep into the landscape, creating dramatic cliff walls and ledges. Visitors standing on the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile below, and look out over the ridges and cliffs that run as far as the eye can see.<br><br>

The South Rim, about 4.5 hours by car from Las Vegas, is the most visited section of Grand Canyon National Park. This is where you'll find a large visitor center, regular bus service along the Rim in the high season, and a walkway that runs along the canyon with numerous viewing points and platforms. Several wonderful hikes, including the Bright Angel Trail, leave from here.<br><br>


The Skywalk, a glass bridge leading out over the edge of the Grand Canyon is another popular attraction. It is located at Eagle Point, on the West Rim. This area is about a four-hour drive from the South Rim, but usually less than a 2.5-hour drive from Las Vegas. If you are planning a day trip from Las Vegas, this area is a good option.<br><br>

The North Rim, which also has lookout areas, provides a different perspective. This section of the park is less visited and has limited access from November to May due to snow and winter conditions.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">Situated along the Canada-US border, Niagara Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in the world. The water from Lake Erie flows into Lake Ontario over these massive waterfalls, known for the great quantity of water that is constantly tumbling over the vertical drop.<br><br>

Niagara Falls is actually a set of three falls: It consists of the largest section, known as Horseshoe Falls, with a drop of 187 feet; a second section on the American side of the river, known as the American Falls, with a drop of 89 feet; and a much thinner section located next to the American Falls, known as Bridal Veil Falls, with a drop of 78 feet.<br><br>

Views are good on both sides of the river, but the Canadian side gives a very different perspective and is worth a visit if you don't mind crossing the border into Canada.<br><br>

Summer is the most popular time to visit Niagara Falls, when the weather is warm, gardens are in bloom, and wandering around is pleasant. Winter provides a unique opportunity to see the snow-covered shores and ice-covered railings, street signs, and trees. It's truly a winter wonderland.<br><br>

On clear days, the plume of mist rising from Niagara Falls can be seen from as far away as the CN Tower in downtown Toronto, Canada, on the opposite shore of Lake Ontario.</font face></p>

Listed as one of the new seven wonders of the world, Machu Picchu is known as the Incas’ ancient ceremonial center. Located high up above the Urubamba River, the complex set of ruins provides a dramatic setting against the lush mountain sides. Getting here will take time and planning, starting with a train ride from Cusco, Urubamba, or Ollantaytambo to the small village of Aguas Calientes. From there, you will take a bus up to the ruins. You may also want to consider a one to four-day hike on the Inca Trail, which leads you into Machu Picchu for a rare experience.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about Statue of liberty</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino"> One of Brazil’s most iconic monuments and Rio’s most visited attraction, the statue of Christ the Redeemer was completed in 1931 and stands 98 feet tall, with horizontally outstretched arms spanning 92 feet. The work of Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski and Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa is made of reinforced concrete clad in a mosaic of thousands of triangular soapstone tiles. The statue stands on a square stone pedestal about 26 feet high, which itself is situated on a deck atop the mountain’s summit. The base encloses a chapel that is popular for weddings. The statue has become emblematic of both the city of Rio de Janeiro and the whole nation of Brazil and is the largest Art Deco-style sculpture in the world.<br><br>

In addition to the symbolic importance within the Catholic community, the statue is also one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and provides spell-binding views over Rio de Janeiro and the bay from the summit of Corcovado, 2310 feet above the city. The area on which it stands is part of the Tijuca National Park, and a rack railway climbs two miles to a broad plaza at the top. A mid-point stop on the railway leads to trails through the Tijuca National Park, replete with springs, waterfalls, and a wide variety of tropical birds, butterflies, and plants.

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about Iguaçu Falls</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">At the point where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina meet, ten miles before joining the Parana River, the Iguaçu River flows over rough, uneven ground, and then, amidst the exuberant forest, spectacularly hurls itself into a semicircular chain of 247 irregular waterfalls that thunder down into the gorge below. Just above the falls, the river is constricted to a quarter of its usual width, making the force of the water even stronger. Some of the falls are more than 330 feet high and they cover such a broad area that you’ll never see all of them at once, but you do get the broadest panorama from the Brazilian side.<br><br>

A visit to the Iguazu falls is a heart-stopping, visceral experience, while the power and noise of the cascades, which extend nearly 1.85 miles, will live forever in your memory. The falls lie split between Brazil and Argentina in the UNESCO-acclaimed Iguaçu National Park, where subtropical rainforests are home to more than 1,000 species of birds and mammals, including deer, otters, ocelots, and capybaras. Catwalks and a tower offer different perspectives, and one bridge reaches all the way to the largest water curtain, known as the Garganta do Diabo (Devil’s Throat), which drops more than 262 feet into a creamy white pool. You can cross to the Argentinian side for closer views from catwalks that extend farther into the center of the falls. The two sides offer different perspectives and views, so it’s a good idea to plan to see both. <br><br>


The Iguazu River is a tributary of the Parana River and an important geographical and political feature of the South American continent. The river forms a natural boundary between Brazil and Argentina, separating Parana State and Misiones Province. The Iguazu Falls are located about 23 kilometers above the river’s confluence with the Parana River, at the Brazil-Argentina border. The waterfall is part of the Iguazu National Park, a 2,530-square kilometer national park divided into Puerto Iguazu National Park (Argentina) and Foz de Iguazu (Brazil). In Argentina, the falls are about 18 and 29 kilometers from Puerto Iguazu and Foz de Iguazu cities, while in Brazil, they are 27 and 29 kilometers from the respective cities.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about Capacabana , Rio de Janeiro</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino"> Occupying a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the sea, Copacabana − downtown Rio’s most fashionable district − follows Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, and is famous for its magnificent two-and-a-half-mile curved beach. Skyscraper hotels, apartment houses, cafés, shops, nightclubs, restaurants, theatres, live music bars, street fairs, and pubs line the waterfront. <br><br>

The neighborhood is a blend of Brazilian soul; it is crowded, rowdy, and traditional. However, the most powerful draw in Copacabana is still the fantastic view of the coast and the incredible white-sand beach alongside the rolling surf.<br><br>

The beach is separated from the buildings and the traffic by a broad promenade paved in black and white mosaic in a rippled pattern inspired by Rocio’s Square in Lisbon, Portugal. The huge strip of sand bordering Copacabana Beach is not the result of a natural process; during the ’70s, a large land reclamation increased the area of the beach, which is a popular playground filled with sun-worshippers whenever the weather is fine.</font face></p>
