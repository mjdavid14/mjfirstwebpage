	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">The Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 330-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.<br><br>

Upon the first glimpse, you'll be impressed by the tower's delicate airiness despite its monumental size. Next, the panoramas at each of the three levels will take your breath away.<br><br>

You can dine with a view on the 1st floor or indulge at the Michelin-starred Le Jules Verne restaurant on the 2nd floor. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top floor offers a sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond. Vistas extend as far as 70 kilometers on a clear day.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino">Luxembourg Garden is a perfect for a leisurely afternoon stroll, a fun summer picnic, or even an adventure-filled evening full of running kids and laughter, the Luxembourg Gardens, also known as “Luco,” has something for everyone. Although it looks formal and ordered throughout the year, the garden has a certain playfulness.<br><br>

The locals come here to play a game of chess, tennis, basketball, and pétanque while the children ride the carousels and ponies. The garden has a vibrant playground for kids with futuristic-looking slides and forts, natural wooden structures, and a piece of art doubling as a maze.<br><br>

One can also enjoy a traditional game from the 1920s, bateaux à voiles, by renting colorful sailboats and sending them sailing in Grand Bassin duck pond, also known as the octagonal basin or circular basin which sits in front of the Luxembourg Palace in the gardens' south. It is a favorite spot for children and one of the most popular parks in Paris due to the amount of activities there are for families.<br><br>

The garden also has the largest puppet theatre (marionette theater) in the city (Théâtre des Marionnettes).<br><br>

The Luxembourg Garden is divided into two sections, an English-style garden and a French-style garden (jardin à la française), both separated by a geometric forest of trees planted in a quincunx pattern (a number five pattern on a dice). The English garden is located in the southern part and has an orchard with some of the oldest apple varieties.<br><br>

Traditionally, the garden was a hotspot for Parisian high society. The intellectuals, the bourgeois, and the nannies. It was opened to the public in 1642. The Luxembourg Garden is filled with iconic green chairs. Initially, you had to pay a woman, called “Les chaisières,” to sit on them.<br><br>

Also known as the Luxembourg Chairs, they are a common sight in some of the most popular gardens of Paris. Want to explore the fascinating history behind green chairs, why the French senate is involved.</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about cologne cathedral</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino"> is a cathedral in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia belonging to the Catholic Church. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Cologne and of the administration of the Archdiocese of Cologne. It is a renowned monument of German Catholicism and Gothic architecture and was declared a World Heritage Site[4] in 1996.[5] It is Germany's most visited landmark, attracting an average of 20,000 people a day.[6] At 157 m (515 ft), the cathedral is the tallest twin-spired church in the world, the second tallest church in Europe after Ulm Minster, and the third tallest church of any kind in the world.[7]

It is the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe and has the second-tallest spires. The towers for its two huge spires give the cathedral the largest façade of any church in the world. The choir has the largest height-to-width ratio, 3.6:1, of any medieval church.[8][failed verification]

Construction of Cologne Cathedral began in 1248 but was halted in the years around 1560,[9] unfinished. Attempts to complete the construction began around 1814 but the project was not properly funded until the 1840s. The edifice was completed to its original medieval plan in 1880.[10]

Cologne's medieval builders had planned a grand structure to house the reliquary of the Three Kings and fit for its role as a place of worship for the Holy Roman Emperor. Despite having been left incomplete during the medieval period, Cologne Cathedral eventually became unified as "a masterpiece of exceptional intrinsic value" and "a powerful testimony to the strength and persistence of Christian belief in medieval and modern Europe".[4] Only the telecommunications tower is higher than the cathedral</font face></p>

	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Arial"><i> Facts about Buckingham Palace</i></font face></p>
	<p text align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Palatino"> Buckingham Palace is a royal residence in London and the administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom.[a][2] Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.<br><br>

Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th century it was enlarged by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.<br><br>

The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally appears to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War; the Queen's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.<br><br>

The original early-19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Charles Long. King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House. The palace has 775 rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.</font face></p>

This remarkably beautiful city in Somerset boasts more fantastic tourist attractions than you could hope to visit in a day.<br><br>

While most famous for the magnificent 2,000-year-old Roman Baths built around the city's rejuvenating hot springs, it's equally well known for its honey-colored Georgian Townhouses, such as those located on Royal Crescent. One of them, #1 Royal Crescent, is open to the public and offers a fascinating look at life in Bath during the Georgian period. Some 500 of the city's buildings are considered of historical or architectural importance, a fact that has resulted in the entire city being granted World Heritage status.<br><br>

Among the most interesting to visit today are the Holborne Museum with its large collections of artworks, silver, and period furniture; the famous Assembly Rooms, star of countless period dramas on TV and home to the interesting Fashion Museum; and the Jane Austen Centre and its neighbor Mary Shelley's House of Frankenstein, which tell the stories of two of Bath's most famous residents.<br><br>
